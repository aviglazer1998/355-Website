		<h2>Basic Info</h2>
		<p>
			I am a second semester senior in Queens College majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. I am originally
			from Texas but currently live in Queens, New York. I love to play basketball, go snowboarding, and watch movies during
			my free time. I am most comfortable coding in HTML, CSS, Java, and SQL. I love to learn new languages and frameworks.
			This class has allowed me to learn more about the lifecycle of a website. I not only got to handle the front end of
			websites but also the backend. I learned how to use the Node.js framework and how to use the Express framework. I also
			learned how to use the MongoDB database. This course has also taught me the importance of using the git version control
			system, and what it means to work with a team on the same project.
